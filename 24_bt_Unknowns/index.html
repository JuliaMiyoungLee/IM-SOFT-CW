            <p>
              Here begins the story of how the legendary Munchy and the (very) quiet Poof became software developers.

              It was a beautiful summer day when Munchy was waddling down the pavement toward the mess hall. Unbeknownst
              to the dozens of rocks that had just been painted and domesticated by overly-excited campus-goers, Munchy was
              approaching the field they were resting upon. Once Munchy was upon them, it appeared that nobody minded his presence.
              They greeted him happily, as most of the rocks were painted in bright colors, easily distinguishing them as non-edible.
              But, there was one unfortunate fellow by the name of Poof. As Munchy greeted the other rocks, he spotted the small, round,
              brown, and very potato-like creature upon the grass. Eyes lighting up, he waddled hurriedly toward it and, in a single gulp,
              had swallowed it whole.<br>

              Poof thought of the numerous times her friends had called her a potato. Would this truly be how her short life as a happy
              domestic rock came to an end? All because of the light brown skin and round contour she had been born with? Fated to die in the
              stomach of a Pokemon that had mistaken her for food?<br>

              Suddenly, Munchy felt an ill sensation overcome his body. Before he knew it, he had thrown right back up the poor little rock
              he had almost erased from existence. As Poof landed back on the grass before Munchy, she looked up at the round, 2 foot tall,
              blue and white giant. It might've been Munchy's imagination, as Poof has no visible mouth, but he could've sworn she broke into a grin. <br>

              Since then, both Poof and Munchy, as well as Aaron and Julia, have been working on a website to report similar accidents in the
              hopes of raising awareness.
